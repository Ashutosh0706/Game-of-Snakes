# Game-of-Snakes
A simple and typical game of snake, which we all used to play in classic cell phones. 
I had used Python for this projet.

1. The main code for the project is present in **game.py**
2. **snake.jpg** is the background image of the game.
3. **back.mp3** is the background music of the game.
4. **gameover.wav** is the music when game overs.
5. requirements for the project is present in **requirements.txt**
6. I had also provided a **hiscore.txt** file which will update automatically according to the high scores in the game.
7. I had also provided a **game.exe** file, which is the file to play the game directly. If you guys just want to play the game and not hard code it, you guys can use that file directly.
